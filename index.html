          <h3 class="scroller-title">Introduction to GOV.UK (video)</h3>
          <p>We launched GOV.UK in October 2012. It replaced the two big central government websites: Directgov and Businesslink.</p>
          <p>The idea was to make something simpler, clearer and faster. Something focused on users.</p>
          <p>Firstly, we took a careful look and worked out what services and information we actually needed to deliver. We eliminated thousands of pages that no one ever visited. Then we made sure that the information we were providing was as easy to find and to follow as possible.</p>
          <p>This, for example, is the page on Directgov that tells you about bank holidays. Now it has all the information you need and you’d think it would be hard to do it better. But looking at how people actually use the site we realised that what most people were searching for was the date of the next bank holiday so we put that right at the top of the page, big and bold.</p>
          <p>We’ve done the same thing to more complex tasks, like working out how much maternity pay you’re entitled to. Before, on Directgov, you’d need to read all this information. On GOV.UK, you just need to answer a few simple questions and the site calculates the answer for you.</p>
          <p>In April 2013 we finished moving all departmental sites to GOV.UK. Together with the sites for Number 10 and the Deputy Prime Minister’s office. So instead of every government page having a different design and different navigation, every site now looks and works the same way.</p>
          <p>GOV.UK is not perfect and it’s not finished. It’s never going to be. It’s designed to improve, to react to user needs. We’ve made thousands of changes to GOV.UK and we make small improvements almost every day. This idea: iterative, responsive change is at the heart of everything we do.</p>
          <p>You should visit us at www.gov.uk. Hopefully, you’ll see something you like. Something simpler, clearer and faster.</p>
